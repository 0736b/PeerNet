#### PeerNet is entirely UDP Packet based ####
 * Unreliable Packets - Only the most recently received packets are processed and they have no guarentee of delivery.
 * Reliable Packets - You are guarenteed to receive every packet, however like with Unreliable, only the most recently received packet is processed.
 * Ordered Reliable Packets - You are guarenteed to receive every packet and process them in exactly the order they were sent.

#### All packets are serialized ####
>>Data Serialization with Cereal - https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal

#### Followed by a quick compression ####
>>Data Compression with ZStd - https://github.com/facebook/zstd

#### Breakdown ####
 * NetSocket - Binds a local IP/Hostname + Port combination to facilitate the sending and receiving of packets.
 * NetPeer - Represents a remote IP/Hostname + Port combination used as a source of receive packets and a destination for send packets.
 * Data must be read in the same order it was written.
 * Any type of data can be written as long as it can be serialized by Cereal.

Loopback Round Trip Time (RTT) for a Keep-Alive packet is sub-250Î¼s (Microseconds).

#### Example ####
```cpp
#include "PeerNet.hpp"

//	User-Defined Peer Class - Must inherit from NetPeer
//	Allows the end-user to seamlessly integrate PeerNet into their application
//	by providing their own derived NetPeer(client) class
class MyPeer : public PeerNet::NetPeer {
  //	This function is called whenever this peer receives a packet
  inline void Receive(PeerNet::ReceivePacket* Packet) {
    printf("Received Packet ID: %i\n", Packet->GetPacketID());
    printf("\t%s\n", Packet->ReadData<std::string>().c_str());
  }
  //	This function is called each time our peer ticks
  inline void Tick() {}
public:
  inline MyPeer(PeerNet::PeerNet* PNInstance, PeerNet::NetSocket*const DefaultSocket, PeerNet::NetAddress*const NetAddr)
    : PeerNet::NetPeer(PNInstance, DefaultSocket, NetAddr) {
    NewInterval(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000 / 60).count());	// 60 Ticks every 1 second
  }
};

//	Factory Class for the User-Defined Peer Class
//	Allows the end-user to seamlessly integrate PeerNet into their application
//	by providing their own pre-initialization logic for their derived NetPeer Class
class MyPeerFactory : public PeerNet::NetPeerFactory {
public:
  //	This function is called whenever a new peer is created
  inline PeerNet::NetPeer* Create(PeerNet::PeerNet* PNInstance, PeerNet::NetSocket*const DefaultSocket, PeerNet::NetAddress*const NetAddr) {
    return new MyPeer(PNInstance, DefaultSocket, NetAddr);
  }
};

//	OperationIDs can be duplicated across different channels
//	However they must be unique within the same channel
enum OperationID {
  Unreliable1 = 0,
  Reliable1 = 0,
  Ordered1 = 0
};

int main() {
  //	Create our NetPeer Factory
  MyPeerFactory* Factory = new MyPeerFactory();

  //	Initialize PeerNet, 10240 SendPackets, 10240 ReceivePackets, 16 maximum NetSockets
  PeerNet::PeerNet *_PeerNet = new PeerNet::PeerNet(Factory, 10240, 16);

  //	Open a socket at 127.0.0.1:9999
  PeerNet::NetSocket* Socket = _PeerNet->OpenSocket("127.0.0.1", "9999");

  //	Use this socket as our default send socket
  _PeerNet->SetDefaultSocket(Socket);

  //	Connect to our socket, represented as a NetPeer
  PeerNet::NetPeer* Peer = _PeerNet->GetPeer("127.0.0.1", "9999");

  //	Send some Unreliable Packets
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    auto NewPacket = Peer->CreateUnreliablePacket(OperationID::Unreliable1);
    NewPacket->WriteData<std::string>("I'm about to be serialized and I'm unreliable!!");
    Peer->Send_Packet(NewPacket);
    i++;
  }

  //	Send some Reliable Packets
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    auto NewPacket = Peer->CreateReliablePacket(OperationID::Reliable1);
    NewPacket->WriteData<std::string>("I'm about to be serialized and I'm reliable!!");
    Peer->Send_Packet(NewPacket);
    i++;
  }

  //	Send some Ordered Packets
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    auto NewPacket = Peer->CreateOrderedPacket(OperationID::Ordered1);
    NewPacket->WriteData<std::string>("I'm about to be serialized and I'm ordered!!");
    Peer->Send_Packet(NewPacket);
  }

  //	Wait 10 seconds
  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(10));

  //	Print out our Round-Trip-Time
  printf("\n\tRound-Trip-Time:\t%.3fms\n\n", Peer->RTT_KOL().count());

  //	Shutdown PeerNet
  delete _PeerNet;
  delete Factory;

  std::system("PAUSE");
  return 0;
}
